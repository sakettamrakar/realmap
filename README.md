# CG RERA Platform

This repository contains the end-to-end stack for scraping the Chhattisgarh RERA portal, running QA and enrichment pipelines, loading data into Postgres, and serving it via a FastAPI backend and React/Vite frontend.

Full documentation now lives under the `docs/` tree:

- **Overview**: `docs/00-overview/product-overview.md`
- **Architecture**: `docs/00-overview/architecture-summary.md`
- **Glossary**: `docs/00-overview/glossary.md`
- **Getting started**: `docs/01-getting-started/quickstart.md`

Developers and operators should start with the quickstart, then follow links into engineering and operations docs as needed.
