# QA Field QA Fix Plan

| Pattern | QA Example | Root Cause Hypothesis | Suggested Code Changes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Section headers with embedded metadata are not mapped | `CG_PCGRERA240218000002 – project_details.tehsil` reported as `missing_in_json` in `outputs/demo-run/runs/run_20251117_142842_d3db76/qa_fields/qa_fields_report.json` | The heading appears as `Project Details [ Registration No : … ] [ Project Web Address : … ]`, so `_normalize` in `cg_rera_extractor/parsing/mapper.py` produces `projectdetailsregistrationno...` which does not match the canonical `projectdetails` key. As a result, every field under that section is dropped and JSON stays blank. | Normalize section titles by stripping bracketed/parenthetical metadata before removing punctuation, and extend mapper tests/fixtures so headings with brackets flow into the `project_details` logical section. |
| Form inputs never emit values | `CG_PCGRERA240218000002 – project_details.project_name` flagged (same report) even though the HTML shows `<input value="OVERSEAS PALM RESORTS">` | `_extract_value_and_links` only inspects sibling text nodes and uses `get_text()`, so `<input>` and `<textarea>` controls contribute empty strings. | Teach `cg_rera_extractor/parsing/raw_extractor.py` to read `.value` for text/number/date inputs and textareas (including when wrapped in `.controls` divs) so FieldRecords capture the actual values. Update `tests/test_raw_extractor.py` to cover input parsing. |
| Dropdowns return the entire option list | `CG_PCGRERA240218000002 – project_details.district` shows `Select District Balod ...` in `raw_extracted` output, and QA reports it as missing/mismatched | For `<select>` elements, `get_text()` returns all option labels concatenated, so even after mapping the field would contain garbage and never match the expected single value. | Add select-specific handling in `raw_extractor` that picks the selected `<option>` (or first non-placeholder) text/value. Verify with new extractor tests. |
| QA HTML extractor assumes table-based layout | Every monitored field for `CG_PCGRERA240218000002` is `missing_in_html` despite the detail page containing the data | `cg_rera_extractor/qa/field_extractor.extract_label_value_map` only looks for `<table><td>` rows; the CG RERA detail page is built with `<div class="control-group"><label>…</label><input ...></div>`, so QA never finds the labels. | Reuse the hardened raw extractor inside `field_extractor` (normalizing labels with the existing helper) so QA sees the same values as the parser. Expand `tests/qa/test_field_extractor.py` with a form-layout fixture. |
