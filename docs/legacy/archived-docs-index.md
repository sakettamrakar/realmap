# Archived Docs Index

This index lists historical and phase-specific documents that are superseded by the unified documentation under `docs/00-overview`–`docs/05-decisions`.

## Phase / design docs

- `PHASE4_GEO_OVERVIEW.md`
- `PHASE4_GEO_DESIGN.md`
- `PHASE5_AMENITY_OVERVIEW.md`
- `PHASE5_AMENITY_DESIGN.md`
- `PHASE_PRICE_DESIGN.md`
- `PHASE6_API_DESIGN.md`
- `PHASE6_READ_MODEL.md`
- `PHASE6_QA_CHECKLIST.md`
- `PHASE6_ANALYST_TOOLS.md`

Use these for deep historical context on individual phases. For the current view, see:

- Geo: `03-engineering/data-models.md`, `GEO_PIPELINE.md` (until fully merged).
- Amenities & scores: `03-engineering/data-models.md`, `PROJECT_SCORES.md` (until fully merged).
- API & read model: `03-engineering/api-reference.md`, `03-engineering/system-architecture.md`.

## Gap analyses and implementation summaries

- `API_GAP_ANALYSIS.md`
- `API_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`
- `FRONTEND_GAP_ANALYSIS.md`
- `FRONTEND_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`
- `DISCOVERY_GAP_ANALYSIS.md`
- `DISCOVERY_IMPLEMENTATION.md`

These are historical snapshots used during implementation; current behavior is described in:

- Backend: `03-engineering/system-architecture.md`, `03-engineering/code-structure.md`.
- Frontend: `02-user-guide/web-app-usage.md`, `02-user-guide/mobile-ux-guide.md`.

## Archived DB and QA docs

Archived under `docs/_archive/` and retained for historical completeness only:

- `DB_DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md`, `DB_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`, `DB_MODEL_CURRENT.md`, `DB_DELIVERABLES.md`, `DB_PIPELINE_VERIFICATION.md`, `DB_LOADING_TEST_RESULTS.md`, `DB_QUICK_REFERENCE.md`.
- `QA_TESTING_INDEX.md`, `QA_TESTING_GUIDE.md`, `QA_TEST_SUITE_SUMMARY.md`, `QA_ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAMS.md`, `QA_DELIVERY_SUMMARY.md`, `QA_FIX_PLAN.md`, `QA_QUICK_START.md`.
- Misc cleanup/debug/session docs such as `CLEANUP_QUICK_REFERENCE.md`, `CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md`, `CLEANUP_VERIFICATION.md`, `TEST_PLAYBOOK.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`, and `SESSION_SUMMARY_20251117.md`.

The current DB, QA, and pipeline behavior is captured in:

- `03-engineering/data-models.md`
- `04-operations/devops-pipeline.md`
- `04-operations/monitoring-alerting.md`
- `04-operations/troubleshooting-runbook.md`

## Other legacy guides

- `REAL_CRAWL_GUIDE.md`, `DOC_CLEANUP_PLAN.md`, `Debug-Runbook.md`, `Deployment-Guide.md` (these have been consolidated into the current getting-started, operations, and troubleshooting docs).

When researching past behavior or decisions, start from the new docs and fall back to these legacy files only when you need additional historical detail.
