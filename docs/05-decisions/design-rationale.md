# Design Rationale

This document provides a place to capture reasoning behind major schema, pipeline, and UX choices.

Examples of topics that belong here:

- Why certain RERA sections were normalized into dedicated tables and others retained only in raw JSON.
- Trade-offs in the geo pipeline (provider choice, caching strategy, precision levels).
- Design of amenity stats and scoring dimensions, and how they map to downstream UX needs.
- Decisions around discovery features (tags, verification, landmarks) and how they integrate with search.
- UX principles guiding the map/list layout and project detail pages.

Historical phase documents (e.g., geo and amenity design specs, price design notes, frontend gap analyses) can be referenced from here as source material for these rationales.
